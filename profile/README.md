# We were Nahal ðŸŒ³

## Our story

We are developers and product managers who started our work in Amirkabir University of Technology's Internet of Things Laboratory.
After working there for 2 years and having much success in Home Automation Systems, we decided to start our company.
On those days, we were young and wanted to have our startup.

We founded Nahal and started looking for fund, but we couldn't find any.
Amirkabir University also started two separate laboratories and our team divided between those.
Our Nahal died before the actual birthday.
We kept this repository as symbol to our friendship and those golden days that we had together.
